Nexus Neural Network LWP

This wallpaper is based on the AOSP nexus live wallpaper. The code within is from ``Cyanogenmod/android_packages_wallpapers_Basic'' in the cm10.1 branch.

I'll muck about with some of the innards, backport features around, etc. I want this to be the configurable one that I remember from CM7.

Things I've changed:

* CM7 had color schemes for this wallpaper: I want them back
* Somewhere along the line, this was used to demonstrate hdpi vs mdpi resolutions. I want to avoid that. A lot of things will probably be moved into drawable-nodpi

Things I'm looking to change:

* Custom colors: there's some good libraries for this
* Clean up nexus.rs -- I need to learn me some RenderScript.

This code is probably unstable, unsafe, and possibly dangerous. No warranties, caveat emptor, etc. etc. etc.
